## üìä **The Graph Integration**  
DeShip uses **The Graph** to index and query scholarship data, such as:  
- **Total scholarships** (active/completed)  
- **Funding distribution** (released vs. locked funds)  
- **Student's performance** (milestone completion rates)  
- **Recent transactions** (fund releases)
- **Success Rate** (fund distribution)  

### **Subgraph Details**  
- **Subgraph URL**:  
  [https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/105145/de-ship/version/latest](https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/105145/de-ship/version/latest)

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Chainlink Automation**

DeShip leverages **Chainlink Automation** to automate critical actions in scholarship management, removing the need for manual intervention and enhancing transparency.

### ‚úÖ **Automated Functions**
- **Milestone Verification**: Checks if students have completed required milestones.
- **Fund Releases**: Automatically transfers funds to approved students upon milestone completion.
- **Scholarship Status Updates**: Marks scholarships as completed when all milestones are fulfilled.

### üß† **How It Works**
1. **Monitoring**: Chainlink nodes continuously run `checkUpkeep()` on the `AutomationHandler` contract.
2. **Triggering Actions**: If upkeep is needed, `performUpkeep()` is executed to:
   - Validate milestone completion.
   - Release corresponding funds.
   - Update scholarship statuses on-chain.
3. **Transparency**: Every action is verifiable and logged on the blockchain for audit purposes.
