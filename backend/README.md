# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

Remember to run in backend/ directory

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/RoleNFT.js --network scrollSepolia
npx hardhat verify {contract_address} --network scrollSepolia
```
